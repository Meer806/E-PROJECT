                        alt="Mercury">
                    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet, with extreme temperatures and no atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is
                        named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and
                        the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same
                        surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless
                        impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris
                        Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter of the
                        planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an
                        expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact
                        event remnants.

                        Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2
                        ratio. This relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to
                        the stars". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176
                        Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in
                        sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be
                        in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.

                        Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has widely varying sunlight
                        intensity and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night
                        to 420 °C (790 °F) during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet's poles are
                        permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests that water ice could be present in the craters.
                        Above the planet's surface is an extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic field that is
                        strong enough to deflect solar winds. Mercury has no natural satellites.

                <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System, providing light and energy</p>
                <p>The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot
                    plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from
                    its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is
                    by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of
                    veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since
                    antiquity.

                    The Sun orbits the galactic centre at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. Its distance from
                    Earth defines the astronomical unit, which is about 1.496×108 kilometres or about 8 light-minutes.
                    Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. The Sun's mass is about
                    330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly
                    three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with
                    much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

                    The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is
                    actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of
                    matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the centre; the
                    rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot
                    and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core
                    fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter
                    into energy.

                <p>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere and is the hottest planet in the solar system</p>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and
                    size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial
                    planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the
                    surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure 92 times that of Earth's
                    at sea level. These extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state at Venus's
                    surface.

                    Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly
                    induced magnetosphere is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. Internal heat
                    escapes through active volcanism,[21][22] resulting in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus
                    is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, that have no moons.[23]
                    Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers. Venus may
                    have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment,[24][25] before a
                    runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into its present state.[26][27][28]

                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.[23]
                    This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid
                    surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of
                    Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of
                    continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat
                    humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more
                    water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust
                    consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
                    earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most
                    of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

                    Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most
                    meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor
                    is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor
                    acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly
                    carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to
                    persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light.

                <p>Mars, the Red Planet, has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system.</p>
                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in
                    iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest
                    objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for
                    telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar
                    System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar
                    day (sol) is equal to 24.6 hours, and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth
                    days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.

                    The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in
                    southern highlands – this terrain observation is known as the Martian dichotomy. Mars hosts many
                    enormous extinct volcanoes (the tallest is Olympus Mons, 21.9 km or 13.6 mi tall) and one of the
                    largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km or 2,500 mi long). Geologically, the
                    planet is fairly active with marsquakes trembling underneath the ground, dust devils sweeping across
                    the landscape, and cirrus clouds. Carbon dioxide is substantially present in Mars's polar ice caps
                    and thin atmosphere. During a year, there are large surface temperature swings on the surface
                    between −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) to 5.7 °C (42.3 °F)[c] similar to Earth's seasons, as both planets have
                    significant axial tilt, Earth at 23.5 degrees and Mars at 25 degrees.

                <p>Jupiter is the largest planet, with a massive storm known as the Great Red Spot</p>
                <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with
                    a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly
                    less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth and a tenth
                    that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period
                    of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon
                    and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the
                    chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

                    Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial
                    phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's
                    atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior. It contains
                    trace elements and compounds like carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon, ammonia, water vapour, phosphine,
                    hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons. Jupiter's helium abundance is 80% of the Sun's, similar to
                    Saturn's composition.

                <p>Saturn is famous for its beautiful ring system made of ice and rock.</p>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It
                    is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth
                    the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is
                    almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance
                    of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.

                    Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic
                    hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas.
                    Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current
                    in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which
                    is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's
                    greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about a twentieth that of Jupiter.[32] The outer
                    atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind
                    speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).

                <p>Uranus is an ice giant that rotates on its side with faint rings.</p>
                <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the
                    planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy
                    calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the
                    lowest minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's planets. It has a
                    marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means
                    that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous
                    sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

                    Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets.
                    Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a
                    thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via
                    hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have originated from comets)
                    have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's
                    atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),[23] variations in its polar cap, and
                    its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant
                    planets, the cause of which remains unclear.

                    Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and many natural
                    satellites. The extremely dark ring system reflects only about 2% of the incoming light. Uranus's 28
                    natural satellites include 18 known regular moons,

                <p>Neptune is the windiest planet, with intense storms and deep blue coloration.</p>
                <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the
                    Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
                    times the mass of Earth. Compared to Uranus, its neighbouring ice giant, Neptune is slightly more
                    massive, but denser and smaller. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids,[21] it has no
                    well-defined solid surface, and orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1
                    astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of
                    the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.[e]

                    Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was not
                    initially observed by direct empirical observation. Rather, unexpected changes in the orbit of
                    Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by
                    an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was mathematically predicted from
                    his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently
                    directly observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[2] by Johann Gottfried Galle within a degree
                    of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly
                    thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining moons were located telescopically until the 20th
                    century.
